usage: CalculatePalindromeLength.py [-h] -tc TOTALCHARS [-th THRESHOLD] [-mr MAXRUNS] [-s]

Used to calculate the maximum word length of a palindrome given the total number of characters in
the pool with a probability threshold and/or maximum number of calculation runs.

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -th THRESHOLD   Probability decimal. When the probability is less than or equal to this number
                  stop calculating. Set to -1 to ignore this stop condition. (Default is 0.000001)
  -mr MAXRUNS     The maximum number of times calculate is allowed to run. (Default is 400)
  -s              Shows the processing of the probabilities by printing to the terminal. (Default
                  is False)

required arguments:
  -tc TOTALCHARS  Total number of characters in the character set that will be used to make
                  palindromes.
